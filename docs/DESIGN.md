# Design System: 07-demo-site

## Visual Philosophy
The design follows a **Premium Corporate / High-Fidelity Portfolio** aesthetic. It uses deep slate and indigo color schemes with subtle glassmorphism and modern typography to convey technical authority.

## Design Patterns
-   **Glassmorphism**: Backdrop blurs on fixed navigation and card elements.
-   **Advanced Typography**: Extreme tracking on main headers; high-contrast font choices.
-   **Smooth Motion**: Scroll-synchronized headers and spring-based progress tracking.

## Color Palette
-   **Base Surface**: Slate-950 (#020617)
-   **Dashboard Background**: Slate-50 (#f8fafc)
-   **Primary Highlight**: Indigo-500 (#6366f1)
-   **Typography High**: Pure White (#FFFFFF)
-   **Typography Low**: Slate-600 (#475569)

## Interaction Design
-   **Scroll Indicator**: A spring-damped progress bar at the top level.
-   **Lift-on-Hover**: Subtle vertical translation on project cards.
-   **Staggered Entrance**: Skill bars filling up as they enter the viewport.
